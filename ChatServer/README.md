For this assignment you are to develop a chat server (and corresponding html pages) which allow a user to 

- Connect to an existing chatroom
- Create a new chatroom

When a user connects to a room they should start a websocket which allows them to receive messages from all other persons connected to the same room. 

A recommended way to break this assignment out is to try them in this order

- Server - start with the server
- Client - see if you can make an initial test connection and message to/from the server
- Two way chat - with two clients try a two way chat
- Chatrooms - finally add chatrooms for groups of users
